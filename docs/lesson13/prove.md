# W13 Prove: Final Project - Peer Review
## Instructions
During class you will be placed into groups to perform a peer review of your tutorial. In the same way we review code, software engineers also review documentation including requirements, design, test cases, and user guides. Use the following checklist to guide your review:

* Are the stated performances of the data structure operations correct?
* Is recursion discussed correctly with the tree module?
* Are there two problems presented for each module (example problem and student problem)?
* Are the instructions for each problem clear to the student?
* Are there any problems with the Markdown formatting (e.g. links, pictures, tables, bullets)?
* Identify the best part of the tutorial.
* Identify the one part of the tutorial that could be improved.

At the end of class, write your name on the attendance sheet at the front of the classroom to get credit for the review activity. You should take the feedback of your peers to improve your tutorial before final submission next week.
