# W11 Prove: Final Project - Status Report 1
## Instructions
To ensure that you are making good progress on the final project and to receive feedback, you need to submit the draft of one of your data structure topic Markdown files for a grade and teacher review. Do not submit the entire tutorial.

For your example and sample problem on each data structure, here's a strategy for coming up with good ones:

1. Identify the benefits of the data structure
    * Example: Queue is good at keeping things in order
2. Come up with a hobby or two
    * Example: I like Jeeps and modifying my Jeep
3. Do something that solves a problem or scenario with your hobbies using the data structure's strength
    * Example: Use a queue to keep track of the Jeep mods so that I know what to perform maintenance on next

**Your examples & problems should be using the data structure rather than implementing them.**
