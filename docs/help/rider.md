## What is Rider?

JetBrains Rider is a cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that will speed up development and give you experience that will prepare you for coding in the workplace. Using this tool will give you *many* advantages over Visual Studio Code (which you probably have used in the past). Rider supplies better coding helps, a working **Run** button, help with debugging errors, and is used across the industry to increase productivity in .NET development.

## Obtaining a Student License

You will need to activate a [student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students){:target="_blank"} which involves creating an account and supplying your BYU-Idaho email address.

Apply for a student license: [https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)

{% include image.html url="jetbrains-student-email.png" description="Use your BYU-Idaho Email Address" caption="Fill out the form" %}

You will receive an email asking you to verify and log in with your JetBrains account. You will need to create an account. This account does not have to be your BYU-Idaho email address, as the student license verification will tie the student email with the account regardless.

Next, you open Rider and select the option to activate your license via the JetBrains Account. It will use your default browser to log in to your JetBrains account. After logging in, your license will be shown in Rider, and you can click Activate to begin using Rider.

## Rider Setup

Before you install Rider, make sure you have your [student license](#obtaining-a-student-license). There are 2 ways to install Rider, using the JetBrains Toolbox (which allows you to install all JetBrains products), and simply installing Rider as a stand-alone application.

### Using JetBrains Toolbox (preferred)

Follow the instructions provided on [JetBrains Toolbox app website](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/){:target="_blank"} to install the JetBrains Toolbox. Once the Toolbox is running, click its icon in your notification section of your operating system and look for Rider on the list of available tools, and click the `Install` button. The toolbox will let you know when there are updates to your installed tools.

### Rider as a Stand-Alone Application

Follow the instructions provided on the [Rider download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/){:target="_blank"}. Once downloaded, follow the prompts to install Rider. The first time Rider starts up, it will prompt you for color theme, additional plugins, and keyboard mappings. If you've only ever used VS Code, you should pick the VS Code (not Visual Studio) keyboard mappings as it will behave more like VS Code. Most students should not install any additional plugins as Rider comes ready to use.

> If Rider does not start properly, check the [system requirements](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet/download/system-requirements/#section-rider) to make sure your system can run it.

## Using Rider

By default, Rider is ready to use for .NET development. Under this section are a few things that can help make your life easier or can help when something doesn't go right.

### Opening Files With a Single Click

### Why Doesn't the _Run_ Button Work?

### Using Version Control

### It's Broke... How Do I Reset It?

### Navigating Assignments with TODOs

For almost all of your teach one another assignments and prove assignments, you will be cloning a repository, making changes, and then committing and pushing changes to that repository. You will then submit a link to your repository in canvas as the submission. For cloning, committing, and pushing changes we *strongly* encourage you to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/){:target="_blank"} over any other tools. I've seen other tools lose track of changes, miss files, or experience authentication issues.

### GitHub Classroom
We will use GitHub Classroom to manage access to assignments and repositories so that teachers and TAs have access to your submissions. You will need to have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}. There is nothing to install, simply click on the links in iLearn to create your repositories for your assignments using GitHub Classroom.

## Downloading Course Files
In the Teach activities and Prove assignments, you will frequently be asked to download documents and files. The instructions will be a page like this one, but the code will be a link to GitHub Classroom for you to "Accept the Assignment". This will create your own personal GitHub repository with a copy of the starting files. It is expected that you make the appropriate changes to the files and then commit and push those changes back to that same repository.

Every file that you download contains the following warning: "It is a violation of BYU-Idaho Honor Code to post or share this code with others or to post it online. Storage into a personal and private repository (e.g. private GitHub repository, unshared Google Drive folder) is acceptable." It is very important that you follow these rules for all material in the course.

The Prove assignments will include a Response Document that you must use to provide your responses to questions. When you submit your assignment, you will need to submit the completed Response Document along with any required code files.

## Preparing for the Final Project
Starting in Week 10, the course will be devoted to working on your final project. The [Week 10 Prepare](../lesson10/prepare) contains the full description of the project. You will be asked to create a detailed tutorial about some of the data structures you have learned during the course. To prepare for the project, you are encouraged to begin taking weekly notes about each data structure with special attention to the following:
* What is the purpose of this data structure and when is it used?
* What is the performance of this data structure (you learn about performance in Week 2)?
* How does the data structure work and how do you use it with C#?
* What are some common errors you may encounter while using the data structure?
* The reading and the assignments contain several problem that require the use of data structures. Can you write additional problems on your own to solve?
