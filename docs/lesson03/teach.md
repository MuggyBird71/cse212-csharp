# W03 Teach: Group Practice

## Instructions

These problems should be completed and discussed as a group. Answers are provided below.

### Problem 1 - Simple Stack
1. Open the following PDF copy of code: [teach-problem1.pdf](teach-problem1.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Note: You should not execute this code. After you complete these practice problems, you are welcome to execute the code).
2. This code has a varied mix of push and pop operations performed on a stack. Individually, manually walk through the code and predict what the final print statement will display. Even if you are good at keeping track of information in your mind, you should use a sheet of paper to keep track of the stack after each step.
3. When you are done, compare your answers from everyone in the group and then take a look at the [solution](teach-problem1-solution.pdf){:target="_blank"} and discuss it together.
  
## Problem 2 - Complicated Stack  
1. Open the following PDF copy of code: [teach-problem2.pdf](teach-problem2.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Note: You should not execute this code. After you complete these practice problems, you are welcome to execute the code).
2. The code does "something." Read through the code and form a hypothesis of what it does. You should write down your thoughts before you proceed to the next step.
3. Test your hypothesis by "running" the following three tests. You should not run the C# code on your computer. You should use paper and pencil to desk check the code using the inputs provided below. What will the function return if you input line is equal to:
    * `(a == 3 or (b == 5 and c == 6))`
    * `(students]i].Grade > 80 and students[i].Grade < 90)`
    * `(robot[id + 1].Execute(.Pass() || (!robot[id * (2 + i)].Alive && stormy) || (robot[id - 1].Alive && lavaFlowing))`
4. Identify where in the code a value of true or false will be returned for each of these three example inputs. If a false is returned, what is the contents of the stack when the failure was detected?
    
  5.  When you are done, take a look at the [solution](teach-problem2-solution.pdf){:target="_blank"} and discuss it together.
