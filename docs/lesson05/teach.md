# W05 Teach: Group Practice

## Instructions
These problems shoul be completed and discussed as a group. Answers are provided below.

### I. PROBLEM 1 - UNIQUE LETTERS
  1. Download the following code and load it into your code editor: [file here]()
   
  2. This code will determine if a string has all unique letters. For example, "abcdefg" has unique letters but "abccdefg" does not because the "c" is repeated more than once. The code is implemented using loops which results in an O(n^2) performance.
   
  3. Answer the question together: how can unique letter function be written wiht O(n) performance using a set? As you answer this question, talk about the behavior, purpose and/or performance of a set to help you arrive at an answer.
  
  4.  When you think you know how to solve the problem (tale no more than five minutes), [read the answer to the question]() and compare wiht your initial answer.
   
  5. Based on your understanding, replace the code in the unique_letters method, so it achieves O(n) using a set.
   
  6. When you are done, take a look at the [solution]() and discuss it together.

### II. PROBLEM 2 - DISPLAY SUMS
  1. Download the following code and load it into your code editor: [file here]()
   
  2. Your goal is to write a program that will find and display all pairs of numbers in a list that sum up to 10. No duplicates should be displayed. This could be done in O(n^2) with a loop within a loop. However, using a set, this can be done in O(n) time. You should assume that the list of numbers provided has no duplicates.
    
  3. Answer this question together: how can you solve the problem using a set data structure? As you answer this question, talk about the behavior, purpose, and/or performance of a set to help you arrive as the answer.
   
  4. When you think you know how to solve the problem (take no more than five minutes), [read the answer to the question]() and compare with your initial answer.
   
  5. Based on your undertanding, implement the display_function.
   
  6. When you are done, take a look at the [solution]() and discuss it together.
