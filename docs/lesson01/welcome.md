## About CSE 212
Welcome to CSE 212 - Programming with Data Structures. This course is intended for students who have studied Python including functions and classes. As you progress towards a career as a software engineer, this course will prepare you to effectively use data structures and increase your programming skills. The successful CSE 212 student will develop the following skills:

* Problem Solver: Apply a systematic approach to writing code to solve problems involving data structures.
* Evaluator: Evaluate the performance of alternative solutions for code containing data structures using big O notation.
* Reviewer: Predict the purpose and behavior of existing code containing data structures.
* Tester: Discover defects using testing in code containing data structures.
* Conversant: Articulate the answers to technical questions involving data structures.
* Self-Reliant: Solve problems using data structures independently.

Data structures are containers that hold information. There are different data structures which are suited for different purposes. In this course, you will study the following data structures: dynamic array, stack, queue, set, map, linked list, and tree. You will also learn about big O performance and recursion.

The course is divided into three phases:

* Phase 1 - Prepare (Lessons 1-5)
    * You will learn programming skills and techniques and apply them to data structures.
    * You will complete practice problems with other students and discuss the solutions together.
    * Your individual assignments will be similar to the practice problems.
* Phase 2 - Teach (Lessons 6-9)
    * You will learn complex data structures and rely on your skills discovered in the Prepare phase.
    * You will have a set of problems to individually solve each week.
    * You will meet with other students for a set amount of time each week to collaborate on these problems (without sharing code).
* Phase 3 - Prove (Lessons 10-14)
    * You will demonstrate what you learned in the Prepare and Teach phases by completing a final individual project.
    * Class time will be given to work on your final project.

This course is designed to provide opportunities for you to learn with your peers while at the same time demonstrating your personal mastery of the material. You should only collaborate with other students as directed in the assignments. When working with TA's, tutors, and other individuals outside of class, you should not seek or receive direct help in answering a problem that you were expected to answer on your own. You should seek help to learn course material and then demonstrate your understanding on your own.

Many programming problems in this course have solutions that with some effort could be found online. You should resist the temptation to use online solutions in favor of solving the problems on your own. For this purpose, many of the assignments will require written responses in addition to Python code. When you interview with potential employers, you will not have the luxury of a web search engine to help you answer the question. You will need to be prepared to articulate your answers clearly to others. The successful CSE 212 student will gain this skill.

This course requires that you already know how to write software in Python. If you need a review of Python, you should look at the [W3Schools Python Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). Focus should be given to the following modules: variables, data types, strings, functions, loops, and classes.

## Course Reading
Each lesson will have reading in I-Learn. During the Prepare phase of the course, the reading will include material for a new data structure and new programming skill. During the Teach phase of the course, only a new data structure will be presented. No new material will be presented during the Prove phase except for the details of the final project.

Each of the readings will include an overview of the topic including several examples. The application of the topic to Python and the performance implications will also be discussed. Key terms will be highlighted when first used in each of the readings. Definitions for these key terms is summarized in the last section of each reading.

In addition to the reading provided, there is plenty of documentation on the internet and in libraries, including the BYU-Idaho online databases. You may want to visit the [Safari Books Online](http://go.oreilly.com/byu-idaho) database supported by the BYU-Idaho library and search for various books on the subject of data structures.

## Development Environment
The development environment for this course is similar to previous Python courses. Your development environment must be functional to successfully submit assignments during the first lesson.

### .NET Core - C#
### JetBrains Rider
### Visual Studio Code
**TODO MODIFY FOR C#**

The preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for BYU-Idaho programming classes is Visual Studio Code. If you already have this tool installed from a previous class, then you will not need to take any additional action. If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed, you should visit the [Visual Studio Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website and follow the instructions. After installation, you should install the Python Extension for Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code should prompt you to install this after you create your first Python (.py) file.

The following websites may be useful for installing these tools:

* Visual Studio Code Tutorial
* Visual Studio Code Videos (the first four videos provide a good introduction)

### GitHub Classroom

## Downloading Course Files
In the Teach activities and Prove assignments, you will frequently be asked to download documents and files. Depending on the browser you are using, the file may cause additional tabs to open. If a file is displayed in a tab instead of downloading, then you may need to right click on the link to download the file. When downloading Python files (with a .py extension) your browser may give you a warning about a potential dangerous files. If you were not a programmer, you would not want to download Python files since you may be receiving one from an untrusted person. However, since you are a programmer and are taking a programming class, you should trust these files for download.

Every file that you download contains the following warning: "It is a violation of BYU-Idaho Honor Code to post or share this code with others or to post it online. Storage into a personal and private repository (e.g. private GitHub repository, unshared Google Drive folder) is acceptable." It is very important that you follow these rules for all material in the course.

The Prove assignments will include a Response Document that you must use to provide your responses to questions. When you submit your assignment, you will need to submit the completed Response Document along with any required python code files.

## Preparing for the Final Project
Starting in Week 10, the course will be devoted to working on your final project. The [Week 10 Prepare](../lesson10/prepare) contains the full description of the project. You will be asked to create a detailed tutorial about some of the data structures you have learned during the course. To prepare for the project, you are encouraged to begin taking weekly notes about each data structure with special attention to the following:
* What is the purpose of this data structure and when is it used?
* What is the performance of this data structure (you learn about performance in Week 2)?
* How does the data structure work and how do you use it with Python?
* What are some common errors you may encounter while using the data structure?
* The reading and the assignments contain several problem that require the use of data structures. Can you write additional problems on your own to solve?
