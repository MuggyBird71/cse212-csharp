# W14 Prove: Final Project - Submittal
## Instructions
Unlike previous prove submittal, you need to combine all files in your tutorial into a single compressed file (e.g., zip, rar). This single combined file should include all Markdown (md) files, picture files, Python files, and any other file that is required for someone to read your tutorial. You should submit the single combined file.
